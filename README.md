# Document Retrieval and Question Answering with langchain and transformers

This repository demonstrates a simple document retrieval and question-answering setup using the `langchain` library for document processing and the `transformers` library for language models.

## Document Processing

### Extracting and Embedding Documents

The `Data_loading.py` script in the directory showcases the process of extracting text from PDF documents, splitting them into chunks, and converting these chunks into embeddings for efficient storage and retrieval.


### Retrieval and Question Answering
The model_pipeline_answer.py script in the  directory demonstrates setting up a retrieval pipeline with langchain and using a language model for question-answering.
